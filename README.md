Hotel Room Reservation System
This is a Hotel Room Reservation System built with Laravel, allowing users to book hotel rooms with real-time availability management. The system supports the following features:

Room Booking: Users can select the number of rooms they wish to book, up to a maximum of 5 rooms per guest.

Room Availability: Rooms are displayed per floor with availability status. The system prioritizes booking rooms on the same floor and minimizes travel time if rooms need to be selected across different floors.

Session Management: Bookings are managed through session variables, ensuring that each user can track and manage their reservation during their session.

Visualization: The system visually represents the available rooms and shows how the rooms are assigned to the user.

Random Occupancy: A button to generate random occupancy for rooms simulates a real-world scenario of room availability.

Booking Reset: A button to reset the entire booking system and clear all selections.

This project was designed to optimize room booking by minimizing travel time for guests, with room selection prioritizing proximity and minimizing vertical and horizontal travel.
